Hey!

I'm doing a class that is teaching me how to do static libraries in c.

This was the order of events:

create two .c files that have functions in them
source/hello.c
source/world.c

compile those into object files
objects/hello.o
objects/world.o

create a static library
ar -rcs libhw.a

create a header file and declare prototypes
hw.h

create my app source
hw.c

compile my app (finally)
hello_world
